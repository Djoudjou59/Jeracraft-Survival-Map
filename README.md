# Jeracraft-Survival-Map

Interactive map of the Jeracraft's Minecraft survival server created by me.
Mix of Html/CSS made exclusively by me and some JS scripts (that I modified for the needs of the map) found on the internet.

The purpose of this map is to show the points of interest I found on the server and to inform the newcomers of the evolution of the world

Original Minecraft map provided by Wildfallz

Enjoy ;)

Please, I'm doing the code on my own time instead of playing the game. The least you can do is to say "thank you" instead of doing submarine cloning (it's forbidden because I didn't put a license file which implies that I don't license unless I'm asked to and I don't allow you to clone all my work which includes tens of hours of work....) and to answer on Discord when I ask to test/validate features.
