# Jeracraft-Survival-Map

Interactive map of the Jeracraft's Minecraft survival server created by me.
Mix of Html/CSS made exclusively by me and some JS scripts (that I modified for the needs of the map) found on the internet.

The purpose of this map is to show the points of interest I found on the server and to inform the newcomers of the evolution of the world

Original Minecraft map provided by Wildfallz

Enjoy ;)
